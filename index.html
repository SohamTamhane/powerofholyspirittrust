                Jesus was addressed as excellent master and excellent
                teacher said about truth was you will understand truth and
                the truth shall make you free. <br><br>
    
                John 13-14: “If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also
                ought to wash one another’s feet.”
                If the truth makes free then the person who was unable to
                understand the truth definitely that person is in unknown cramp. <br><br>
    
                Mark 10-1 And he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the
                Jordan, and crowds gathered to him again. And again, as was his custom, he taught
                them again <br><br>
    
                Luke 4: 16-18 16  So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And
                as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up
                to read.  <br><br>
                And He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when He had opened the
                book, He found the place where it was written: <br>
                “The Spirit of the LORD is upon Me, <br>
                Because He has anointed Me <br>
                To preach the gospel to the poor; <br>
                He has sent Meto heal the broken hearted, <br>
                To proclaim liberty to the captives <br>
                And recovery of sight to the blind, <br>
                To set at liberty those who are
                Oppressed. <br><br>
    
                LUKE 22 :39,40 39  Coming out, He went to the Mount of Olives, as He was
                accustomed, and His disciples also followed Him. When He came to the place, He
                said to them, “Pray that you may not enter into temptation.”
                What kind of cramp is this? <br>
                Answer- Wrong idea, tradition, ignorance, super satiation
                and similar things. <br><br>
    
                Proverbs 3: 13-16 <br>
                Happy is the man who finds wisdom, <br>
                And the man who gains understanding; <br><br>
    
                For her proceeds are better than the profits of silver, <br>
                And her gain than fine gold. <br>
                She is more precious than rubies, <br>
                And all the things you may desire cannot compare with her. <br>
                Length of days is in her right hand, <br>
                In her left-hand riches and honour. <br><br>

                PROVERBS 4: 1-2 <br>
                Hear, my children, the instruction of a father, <br>
                And give attention to know understanding; <br>
                For I give you good doctrine: <br>
                Do not forsake my law. <br><br>
    
                PROVERBS 15: 31-33 <br>
                The ear that hears the rebukes of life <br>
                Will abide among the wise. <br>
                He who disdains instruction despises his own soul, <br>
                But he who heeds rebuke gets understanding. <br>
                The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom, <br>
                And before honour is humility. <br><br>
    
                Ignorance, super stations, traditions etc keeping the man deprive from the truth. <br>
                Many of people are unable to answer this question that What is TRUTH? <br>
    
                TIMOTHY 2: 1-5 You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ
                Jesus. And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit
                these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. You therefore
                must endure [a]  hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No one engaged in
                warfare entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who
                enlisted him as a soldier.  5  And also if anyone competes in athletics, he is not
                crowned unless he competes according to the rules. <br><br>
    
                In true sense the purpose to save the cramped people from their cramp is to show
                them the way of salvation and to encourage them to walk in the light of truth. This is
                the only them and this work will be fulfilled with the blessing of God and as per
                guidance of holy spirit. <br><br>
    
                A person committing sin goes away from truth and due to tradition goes away from
                God. The purpose to give the information about the free salvation from God.
                How the man goes away from the truth? Who is doing that and what would be the
                effect of that in the future? To explain all these and to walk in all holy and biblical
                truth and this is the only them of power of holy spirit ministry. <br>
                1 timothy 2-4, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the
                truth.
